2. **Network Diagrams** - Map relationships between threats, targets, and strategies
3. **Time Series** - Plot monitoring data trends over time
4. **Maps** - Show project locations with interactive maps
5. **Your Questions** - Explore the data with your own prompts

## About the Data

The sample data is from **Miradi Share**, a platform for conservation project planning based on the [Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation](https://conservationstandards.org/).

The database contains:
- **7 biodiversity targets** (species and ecosystems to conserve)
- **9 direct threats** (human activities impacting targets)
- **19 strategies** (conservation interventions)
- **77 indicators** with **301 measurements** (monitoring data over time)
- Plus goals, objectives, activities, and more
