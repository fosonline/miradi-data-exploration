## What's Included

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `workshop_colab_template.ipynb` | Interactive notebook with guided exploration |
| `sample_project.sqlite` | Sample conservation project data (Eastern Bay Project) |

## Example Prompts

Try asking the AI:

- "Create a bar chart showing the viability status of all biodiversity targets"
- "Show me measurement trends over time for coral indicators"
- "Which strategies address the most threats?"
- "Create a network diagram showing threat-target relationships"

## About the Data

The sample data is from **Miradi Share**, a platform for conservation project planning based on the [Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation](https://conservationstandards.org/).

The database contains:
- **7 biodiversity targets** (species and ecosystems to conserve)
- **9 direct threats** (human activities impacting targets)
- **19 strategies** (conservation interventions)
- **77 indicators** with **301 measurements** (monitoring data over time)
- Plus goals, objectives, activities, and more
